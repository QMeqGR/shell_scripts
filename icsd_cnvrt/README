ICSD issues:

1. There are some icsd files which
have coordinates listed as 0.3333000
or 0.6667000.  The floating point values
are not high enough precision for VASP during
the symmetry checking routine.  Replace them
with 1/3 or 2/3, repsectively, as appropriate.
The fractions will be properly parsed and will
have the full precision necessary to prevent
errors.

2. There are some icsd files which have the header line

N [some_name] [space group] blah blah blah

The icsd_cnvrt script parses the space group by looking for
the brackets "[" and "]".  If you remove the "[some_name]"
set of brackets which don't contain the space group, then
icsd_cnvrt will properly parse the file.
